# [WIP]Work with ESP-IDF under Clion IDE

Since IDF v4.0 cmake becomes part of the default toolchain, make it quite convenient to develop native esp32 (and further c3, s3) projects with modern IDE like Clion. This could be a great news for newcomers from CS (not EE) like me, to get full assistant from IDE while developing embedded projects. 

No extra plugins is needed. Just a few cmake flags need to be cared about manually.

## Before the beginning

#### This article will cover the following parts

- Run Clion within ESP-IDF enabled environment
- Load and build an esp32 example project in Clion
- Configure the project for esp32c3/s3 target and works with Clion
- Load and build unit-test-app

#### Currently not covered

- flash and monitor inside Clion
- OpenOCD debug

#### Assumed condition

- You are on the latest Linux Mint / Ubuntu. Other deb based distributions should work. Arch users know what they need to do.
- Have ESP-IDF successfully installed and at least examples can be built and flashed from cli.

I strongly recommend to set the `get_idf` alias for convenience. It is not recommended to make IDF available for every console session as default, so at least we should be able to load IDF environment with command as short as possible.

There is also some difference between different desktop environments. I'm on xfce.

#### Check again

Now you should have cloned IDF repo and finished the install progress. You should also have Clion installed and works normally.

For convenience, `get_idf` should also be set as an alias to load IDF specificed environment to current session.

Make sure you can build any projects by following the [official guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html#step-8-build-the-project).

## Setup IDF-enabled Clion

If you ever tried to load IDF projects directly in Clion then cmake will complain about missing toolchains and will not succeed. That is because IDF related dependence is not included in your session which Clion launched from. There is a way to manually configure them out but is too complex and annoying so I personally never recommend that method. Another way is simply launching the Clion from a session where IDF is already available.

Open a terminal and type `get_idf` to load IDF env, then locate where Clion is and launch it. It is expected to have Clion running under IDF now and cmake will automatically sort out everything when IDF projects are opened. No error should be there now!

Not very convenient because everytime you should open a terminal at first, load IDF, and start Clion from command line. This step can also be simplified with the help of a simple bash script.

Create a file under `~/.local/bin`, named `idfclion` with following commands:

```shell
cat << EOF
#!/bin/bash
. /path/to/idf/export.sh
/path/to/clion.sh
EOF > ~/.local/bin/idfclion
```

Where `/path/to/clion.sh` should be replace with true one on your system. The same for `/path/to/idf` . They should be absolute path. Note IDF path is the directory where you have cloned the esp-idf repo.

Then make it executable:

```shell
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/idfclion
```

Now you should able to launch an IDF-enabled Clion with a single command `idfclion`.

With this method no root permission is required and it only works for current user.

Then I'd create a desktop entry for it. It differs with different desktop environment so please search and try it by yourself.

Finally I got those two icons on my desktop

The first one for normal projects and the second one for IDF.

## Open the hello world project

So by now an IDF-enabled Clion is configured, next topic is how to use it.

Switch to IDF repo directory(`$IDF_PATH`) and you will find the `examples` lying here. The directory `examples/get-started/hello_world/` contains a hello-world example ready to be tested.

From Clion menubar choose "Projects" => "Open", navigate to where hello-world project exists

![locate_helloworld](./_res_work_with_clion/locate_helloworld.png)

Press OK. Then Choose "Open as CMake project".

On newer Clion it will ask to trust the project. To make everything works then click "Trust Project".

Now Clion will open a wizard to configure cmake profile. Those settings can also be changed later. To keep the same behavior as idf.py, we can fill the "Build directory" with `build`. Click "OK". That's all.

![clion_helloworld](./_res_work_with_clion/clion_helloworld.png)

You can build from menubar "Build" => "Build Project" to see if everything works.

To flash the firmware onto device, you cannot directly use `idf.py` for that. After the project is loaded a build directory is populated with makefiles generated by cmake, where
